# AcessReel App
This app was built using .NET MAUI and brings the AccessReel website experience to mobile users. Constructed with a user-friendly 
interface and a navigation bar following MVC principles, it provides seamless navigation for anyone looking to explore AccessReel 
content. Additionally, the collaborative input from team members played a crucial role in shaping and refining the app.

We created this app as part of our second group project in the live works class for the Diploma of Advanced Programming. My main 
contributions included developing the navigation bar and resolving front-end interfaces and notification issues.
